## Introduction:
- A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating 
systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to 
control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
 
- Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal 
emulator; however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or Secure Shell are common for server systems. All Unix 
shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for 
condition-testing and iteration.

## C shell:
- The C shell, csh, was modeled on the C programming language, including the control structures and the expression grammar. It 
was written by Bill Joy as a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley, and was widely distributed with BSD Unix. 

- The C shell also introduced many features for interactive work, including the history and editing mechanisms, aliases, 
directory stacks, tilde notation, cdpath, job control and path hashing. On many systems, csh may be a symbolic link or hard 
link to TENEX C shell (tcsh), an improved version of Joy's original version. Although the interactive features of csh have been 
copied to most other shells, the language structure has not been widely copied. The only work-alike is Hamilton C shell, 
written by Nicole Hamilton, first distributed on OS/2 in 1988 and on Windows since 1992. The project has been tested on Ubuntu 
14.05
